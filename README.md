# PintosProjectOperatingSystem

I implemented scheduling and management of kernel threads& argument passing and system calls for user programs in Pintos
All of the work was done on CVS.
Source code added in src/threads/ and src/userprog/ and src/vm/

Log files for each commit done originally on CVS are available in the above folders where source code was added.
